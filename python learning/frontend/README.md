# Frontend (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)

## Setup (Replit or Local)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. The app will run on the port shown in the terminal (default: 5173).

## Features
- Dashboard, Lessons List, Lesson Page (tabbed), Admin Dashboard, Admin Upload
- Dark mode toggle (top right)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Router for navigation

## API Connection
- The frontend expects the backend API at `/api/v1/` (adjust with a proxy or env if needed)
- For Replit, you may need to use the full backend URL (see backend README)

## Customization
- Edit `src/App.jsx` to add more pages or features
- Tailwind config in `tailwind.config.js`
